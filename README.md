The sample data with indictors and the code of the Entropy Weight Method and Coupling Coordination Analysis Model can be downloaded here.
## Entropy Weight Method
The integrated scores of the facilities and perceptions systems can be objectively weighted using the entropy weight method for each indicator within these systems. The entropy weight method employs information entropy to assess the dispersion degree of each indicator: the smaller the entropy value, the greater the indicator's impact (weight) on the comprehensive evaluation.
## Coupling Coordination Analysis Model
To measure the degree of interaction between the two systems, this study utilizes the Coupling Coordination Analysis Model. A higher coupling degree indicates a tighter connection and greater mutual influence between systems. A higher coordination degree suggests more harmonious internal operations and greater consistency in achieving objectives.
